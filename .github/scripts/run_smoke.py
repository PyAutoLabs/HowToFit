"""
Run the workspace smoke test suite: every script under `scripts/`, minus the
exclusions in `config/build/no_run.yaml`.

Coverage is **opt-out**. A new tutorial is smoke-tested the moment it is added;
excluding one is a deliberate, documented entry in `config/build/no_run.yaml` —
the same file the notebook runner already honours, so scripts and notebooks can
no longer disagree about what is skipped.

This replaces the former `smoke_tests.txt` allowlist, under which a script was
tested only if someone remembered to add it. That design left HowToGalaxy
testing 4 of its 26 scripts, and a public teaching notebook stayed broken in
three places because no job had ever executed it (HowToGalaxy #58).

Nothing about discovery, exclusion or environment resolution is implemented
here. This is a thin shim over PyAutoHands' `autohands/run_python.py` — the same
entry point PyAutoHeart's workspace-validation uses for its `run_scripts` job —
so the PR gate and the validation runner cannot drift apart. That runner
provides:

  * recursive discovery, ordering `simulator*` first and then `start_here.py`,
    which is what tutorials depending on simulated datasets need
  * `should_skip()` against `config/build/no_run.yaml`
  * per-script env from `config/build/profile_smoke.yaml`

Mirrors the `/smoke-test` skill so CI and local runs stay in sync.
